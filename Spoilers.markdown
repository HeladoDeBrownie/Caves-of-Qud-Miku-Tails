- Brooding cyanpuffs spawn in most places where other puffers do.
- Unlike other puffers, brooding cyanpuffs always bestow the same fungal infection, miku tails.
- Miku tails will occasionally lash out at creatures within melee reach.
- You will be blamed for your tails' attacks.
- The tails' attack bypasses DV and AV, but not phase or flight, and cannot penetrate multiple times.
- Each miku tails infection can attack independently, even multiple on the same turn.
- If you enable overlay inventory in the options, you can see a pretty tile for your tails in your equip slot.
- The tile of each miku tails infection is chosen randomly from four possible tiles.
